# Image Manipulation Project with OpenCV and Numpy

## Overview

This project showcases various image manipulation tasks using the OpenCV library and Numpy in Python. The goal is to familiarize with basic image processing techniques and demonstrate their application on a sample image.

## Tasks

The following image manipulation tasks are implemented in the project:

1. **Gray Scaling:**
   - Convert the original image to grayscale and save the output as `gray_image.png`.

2. **Scaling:**
   - Scale the grayscale image to half the size in both height and width (256 Ã— 128) and save the output as `gray_image_scaled.png`.

3. **Translation:**
   - Translate the grayscale image by 50 pixels to the right and 50 pixels to the bottom. Save the output as `gray_image_translated.png`.

4. **Flipping:**
   - Flip the grayscale image along the horizontal axis, passing through the center of the image. Save the output as `gray_image_flip_horizontal.png`.
   - Flip the grayscale image along the vertical axis, passing through the center of the image. Save the output as `gray_image_flip_vertical.png`.

5. **Inversion:**
   - Invert the grayscale image and save the output as `gray_image_inversion.png`.

6. **Rotation:**
   - Rotate the grayscale image by 45 degrees in the clockwise direction. Save the output as `gray_image_rotated.png`.

7. **Bonus (Optional):**
   - Bonus tasks involve scaling, translation, and flipping an image along both horizontal and vertical axes on the original RGB image.
